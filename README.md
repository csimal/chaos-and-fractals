# chaos-and-fractals

Various functions and code samples centered around Chaos and Fractals. This was made by C. Simal and J. Mohet as part of their 2019-2020 Master's Course *Chaos et DÃ©terminisme* at Unamur.

## Installation
Most of the code is in [Julia](http://www.julialang.org). In order to run the code, we recommend you use [JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html) as it allows for using Julia in a workflow similar to Matlab.

Once you've installed Julia, you will need to install several community packages. Thankfully, this can be done very easily by running `dependencies.jl`.

The code was initially developped on Julia 1.2.0, but was tested without issues on Julia 1.3.0 (the latest Julia release at the time of writing)

# chaos-and-fractals

Various functions and code samples centered around Chaos and Fractals. This was made by C. Simal and J. Mohet as part of their 2019-2020 Master's Course *Chaos et DÃ©terminisme* at Unamur.

## Installation
Most of the code is in [Julia](http://www.julialang.org). In order to run it, we recommend you use [JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html) as it allows using Julia in a workflow similar to Matlab. Users coming from Matlab should check out [this page](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/) for a detailed list of the differences between both languages.

Once you've installed Julia and downloaded the code, you will need to install several community packages. Thankfully, this can be done very easily by running `dependencies.jl`.

The code was initially developed on Julia 1.2.0, but was tested without issues on Julia 1.3.0 (the latest Julia release at the time of writing)
